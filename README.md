<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

There are many amazing discord bots out there that everyone loves - Dank memer, Mee6, CarlBot etc. I wanted to make a bot that is fun for everyone, so I decided that making a financial stock game bot will be the best one -- maybe the last stock bot you will need on discord.

More features will be added in the feature, you may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to everyone who contributed to this bot!

Use the `README.md` to get started.

## Important Info!!

This is a bot still undergoing rapid development, so please wait for an official release, which would be mentioned in the Matrix server & in the README once it's released!
